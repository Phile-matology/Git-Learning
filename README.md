# Personal
This repository is for personal use such as testing and recording notes.
I'm trying to figure out how a program is built, how to use GIT to deal with certain version problems.
Successfully, I've finished my first pull request and merge branch.
Hope things to be better.

Will editing this text produce a new branch?
This is a testing information.
If so, maybe I should pull request and merge the new branch.
Oh! I discover the choices below.
I'll test the latter.
